## üìå Project Overview
This project implements a **Decision Tree classifier** to predict the likelihood of heart disease using patient health attributes. The goal is to explore supervised machine learning in a healthcare setting and create an interpretable model that highlights important medical risk factors.

---

## üß† Key Concepts
- **Decision Trees**: Used for interpretable classification.  
- **Supervised Learning**: Model trained on labeled patient records.  
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.  

---

## üìÇ Dataset
The dataset contains medical records with features such as:
- Age  
- Sex  
- Chest Pain Type  
- Blood Pressure  
- Serum Cholesterol  
- Fasting Blood Sugar  
- Resting ECG Results  
- Maximum Heart Rate Achieved  
- Exercise-Induced Angina  
- ST Depression Induced by Exercise  
- Slope of ST Segment  
- Number of Major Vessels (Fluoroscopy)  
- Thalassemia Result  

**Target variable** ‚Üí Presence (1) or Absence (0) of heart disease.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Workflow
1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Handle missing values  
   - Encode categorical variables  
   - Split into train/test sets  

2. **Model Training**  
   - Train a Decision Tree Classifier  
   - Visualize the decision tree  

3. **Evaluation**  
   - Accuracy score  
   - Confusion matrix  
   - Feature importance
